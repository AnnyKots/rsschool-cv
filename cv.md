### Code examples (Python) from CodeWars:

*Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.*


```def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 ):
    if (flower1%2==0 and flower2%2!=0) or ((flower1%2!=0 and flower2%2==0)):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
        
      
      
*Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight. Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.*


```def past(h, m, s):
    if  0<=h<=23 and 0 <= m <= 59 and 0 <= s <= 59:
        result = (h*60*60 + m*60 +s)*1000
        return result
```
