### Briefly About Myself:
I’m in my third year of studies towards a bachelor's in computer Sciences and Physics, and I’m also a teacher at the Children’s Programming School.
In my second year at the university, we studied the layout of the site, I liked it, I studied css and html, watched videos in YouTube.
Accidentally found free courses from Rolling Scopes, I liked the idea of "Pay It Forward",  there are a lot of useful materials, there is an opportunity to communicate with like-minded people, motivates that there is a chance to get a job at EPAM in case of successful practice.
Ready to learn and develop in the direction of Frontened. At this stage of my knowledge of English - A2, in the summer I want to start taking lessons in English.

### Code examples (Python) from CodeWars:

*Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.*


```def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 ):
    if (flower1%2==0 and flower2%2!=0) or ((flower1%2!=0 and flower2%2==0)):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
        
      
      
*Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight. Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.*


```def past(h, m, s):
    if  0<=h<=23 and 0 <= m <= 59 and 0 <= s <= 59:
        result = (h*60*60 + m*60 +s)*1000
        return result
```
